# FreeCryptoGenerator

## How Does it Work?
- This program generates free crypto by searching through discarded and unused wallets to find coins.
- It uses the wordlist to generate keys and then checks each key against the blockchain.
- If a wallet is found to contain coins, it is printed out.

## How do I run it
- Start the program by opening CMD and running "start.bat" in the root directory.
